## Do-It-Yourself

Steps to making your own QMK firmware:
1. Start by designing your own layout with [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/)
2. Then *copy the raw data* * and paste it into [Keyboard Firmware Builder](https://kbfirmware.com/), and map the matrix and MCU pins
3. Since the firmware builder uses outdated QMK firmware, you will need to just hit "Save configuration" and then run `qmk import-kbfirmware /path/to/export.json` and QMK will generate the *necessary files*** (I know, more fine print) for you to use in the QMK firmware
4. Build with `qmk compile -kb <your-keyboard> -km default`
5. Flash with `qmk flash -kb <your-keyboard> -km default`
6. Test keyboard with [QMK Configurator Tool](https://config.qmk.fm/#/test)

*The input for the firmware builder is very very picky, so make sure it follows this format:

```
["Esc","!\n1","@\n2","#\n3","$\n4","%\n5","^\n6","&\n7","*\n8","(\n9",")\n0","_\n-","+\n=",{w:2},"Backspace","Cal"],
[{w:1.5},"Tab","Q","W","E","R","T","Y","U","I","O","P","{\n[","}\n]",{w:1.5},"|\n\\","`\n~"],
[{w:1.75},"Caps Lock","A","S","D","F","G","H","J","K","L",":\n;","\"\n'",{w:2.25},"Enter","Menu"],
[{w:2.25},"Shift","Z","X","C","V","B","N","M","<\n,",">\n.","?\n/",{w:1.75},"Shift","Up","Fn"],
[{w:1.25},"Ctrl",{w:1.25},"Win",{w:1.25},"Alt",{w:7.25},"","Fn","Ctrl","Left","Down","Right"]
```
This is a bad example that KLE outputs by default and won't work out of the box with KFB:
```
[{p:"R1"},"Esc",{p:""},"!\n1","@\n2","#\n3","$\n4","%\n5","^\n6","&\n7","*\n8","(\n9",")\n0","_\n-","+\n=",{w:2},"Backspace","Cal"],
[{p:"R2",w:1.5},"Tab",{p:""},"Q","W","E","R","T","Y","U","I","O","P","{\n[","}\n]",{w:1.5},"|\n\\","`\n~"],
[{p:"R3",w:1.75},"Caps Lock",{p:""},"A","S","D","F","G","H","J","K","L",":\n;","\"\n'",{w:2.25},"Enter","Menu"],
[{p:"R4",w:2.25},"Shift",{p:""},"Z","X","C","V","B","N","M","<\n,",">\n.","?\n/",{w:1.75},"Shift","Up","Fn"],
[{p:"SPACE",w:1.25},"Ctrl",{p:"",w:1.25},"Win",{w:1.25},"Alt",{a:7,w:7.25},"",{a:4},"Fn","Ctrl","Left","Down","Right"]
```
Delete any extra stuff (most likely a and p flags) other than the necessary {w:#} flags

** The `qmk import-kbfirmware` utility absolutely sucks and will sometimes mess up a few keys in the layout as well as screwing up pin assignments. Save yourself hours of headbanging and double check these two things if it isn't working as expected.

## Building this firmware

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):
make sammothxc_67key:default

Flashing example for this keyboard:
make sammothxc_67key:default:flash

See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information. Brand new to QMK? Start with our [Complete Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).

## Bootloader

Before flashing, enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB - some may have pads you must short instead
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available

After flashing, the bootloader can now be entered by pressing the lower FN key and Esc simultaneously.
